# Dr. rer. nat. Lutz Oettershagen

I am a postdoctorial researcher at the University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany, working with Prof. Petra Mutzel. 

My primary research area is graph data mining, algorithms for data analysis, and machine learning for graphs. I put a strong focus on mathematical and computational foundations as well as the engineering and application of efficient algorithmic data analysis on dynamic graphs for solving real-world problems. My work focuses on the computational analysis of temporal networks, i.e., graph structures that change their topology over time. Prominent examples are dynamic social networks in which participants build and end friendships over time, communication networks like email networks in which emails correspond to instantaneous connections between users, or human contact networks modeling face-to-face contacts. In my research, I design and analyze methods for obtaining new knowledge from temporal networks.
